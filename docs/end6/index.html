    <br>While you're sitting in silence you wonder if that's the same outcome your coworkers had.<br>
    <br>Had they done the same as you and gone home?<br>
    <br>Or had they try and outrun him...<br>
    <br>You sit in fear wondering if your coworkers are even alive.<br>
    <br>You call the police and they investigate the same vent you crawl into but they find nothing.<br>
    <br>They see no man. Nothing.<br>
    <br>You wonder if you're just going crazy.<br>
    <br>You sit and are just glad you're alive.<br>
