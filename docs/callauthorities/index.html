    <br>You call authorties and they arrive. You fill them in with everything that's happened.<br>
    <br>They go in and search for hours and they come back but find nothing.<br>
    <br>They ask if I'm sure about what I saw and you tell them yes but they don't believe you.<br>
    <br>They start calling you crazy and packing their stuff up.<br>
    <br>You beg them and tell them that you're telling the truth but they don't believe a word you're saying.<br>
