    <br>You start paddling<br>
    <br>It feels like you've been paddling for hours. You're well past the 10 meters.<br>
    <br>You wonder why they even had that 10 meter sign up. Maybe this was why. Maybe you entered some portal through the wave.<br>
    <br>You stop to catch a break for a second. It's silent besides the sounds of the water flowing.<br>
    <br>That's when you hear something. You hear groaning come from deep in the ocean.<br>
    <br>You listen deeper and it gets closer and closer. A weird scary looking sea creature shows itself for a second and disappears.<br>
    <br>You feel as if it was mocking you. Just letting you know that it's there. Trying to scare you.<br>
    <br>You look down and see a familiar sight. A seaweed patch with a cloth caught it in.<br>
    <br>You then realize that all that time paddling you had gone no where. It's like you were stuck in place.<br>
    <br>How was this even possible?<br>
