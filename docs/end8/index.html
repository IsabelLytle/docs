    <br>You don't get much sleep that night but you wake up expecting to see something on the news about it.<br>
    <br>You turn the tv on and...nothing.<br>
    <br>You see nothing on the news. ANY news channel.<br>
    <br>You wonder if you were getting pranked. Maybe yesterday was a sick joke.<br>
    <br>You drive back over there and sure enough they're still there. Just sitting still.<br>
    <br>You wonder why no one cared.<br>
    <br>Could only you see it?<br>
    <br>Were only you haunted by this weirdness?<br>
    <br>Why did this happen?<br>
