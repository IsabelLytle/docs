    <br>You start to dream.<br>
    <br>You see your coworkers.<br>
    <br>You see them trapped. Trapped in a big room with an endless amount of rooms.<br>
    <br>You see the look in their eyes. They look terrified.<br>
    <br>You see different creatures that you didn't even know existed chasing them.<br>
    <br>You wake up and wonder if you could've done anything to change the outcome.<br>
    <br>You also wonder if you had just tried a little harder to get inside if you would've had the same outcome as everyone else.<br>
    <br>You can't help but feel guilty. Like you could've done something.<br>
