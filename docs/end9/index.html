    <br>You wander, run and hide for hours but nothing.<br>
    <br>There was no exit out of this place.<br>
    <br>You were trapped.<br>
    <br>You couldn't do anything.<br>
    <br>You step into a locker and just stare into nothingness.<br>
    <br>You watched as each creature would run by looking for you.<br>
    <br>It's like it was a game. Like the first one to find you and catch you won.<br>
    <br>You got tired from running so decided to try and get some sleep in the locker.<br>
    <br>This was your life you thought.<br>
