    <br>You get up as soon as he turns his back and take off running at full speed.<br>
    <br>You turn down an alley and hide behind a dumpster. The cop takes off running past you, losing you.<br>
    <br>You wonder how you're going to get the handcuffs off when you remember you have tools back at home.<br>
    <br>You walk home hiding your face and the fact that your handcuffed when you finally reach your house.You go into your garage and see a saw.<br>
    <br>You then wonder how you're going to manage to cut them off yourself and realize you need help.<br>
    <br>You call your friend that called earlier but no answer (maybe you should've answered them).<br>
    <br>You decide to just walk to work and figure everything out when you get there.<br>
    <br>You try to avoid anyone looking for you so you go down a bunch of back ways and alleys.<br>
    <br>You see a strange man in an alley and you walk past him trying to avoid any interaction.You notice that he starts to follow you and you keep walking.<br>
    <br>He catches up to you and hits you over the head with something and you black out. You wake up in a yellow office looking building.<br>
    <br>You walk around and you just see nothing. Just more rooms.<br>
    <br>You keep walking and see a ladder going into a hole in the wall and you see a vent on the ceiling.<br>
    <br>Do you...<br>
