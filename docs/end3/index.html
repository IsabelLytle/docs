    <br>You dream about how simple your life was before this weird day.<br>
    <br>You dream about what could've been and what you could've done.<br>
    <br>You wanted a family because of how much you loved your own.<br>
    <br>But maybe you weren't meant to have one. Maybe this was your destiny.<br>
    <br>Maybe this is what your life was meant to be.<br>
    <br>Or maybe this is your destiny because of the choices you made.<br>
    <br>Maybe if you made different choices you wouldn't have been in this situation at all.<br>
