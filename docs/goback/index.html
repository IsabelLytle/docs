    <br>You decide to turn around and go back through the vent.<br>
    <br>You weren't meant to be here.<br>
    <br>You crawl through and finally reach the end. Your heart pounding out of your chest.<br>
    <br>You wonder if that's the same thing that took your coworkers.<br>
    <br>You speed walk out the door and slam it shut. You lay against the door to catch your breathe.<br>
    <br>You drive home, terrified of what you just saw.<br>
    <br>You get home and just sit in silence.<br>
