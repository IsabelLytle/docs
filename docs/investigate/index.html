    <br>You go off on your own and investigate. But find nothing.<br>
    <br>You get ready to just give up when you find a vent that's been unscrewed open.<br>
    <br>You crawl through and get to what feels like a big room. You can't see though because it's pitch black.<br>
    <br>You get your phone out and turn on your flashlight.<br>
    <br>All you see when you turn your flashlight on is a man standing in front of you with a black body and the most terrifying smile you've ever seen.<br>
    <br>You ask who he is and if he can help you but he does nothing but stare at you with his eyes widened.<br>
    <br>You try and walk past him but he steps in front of you.<br>
    <br>You realize he's not gonna let you past.<br>
    <br>Do you...<br>
