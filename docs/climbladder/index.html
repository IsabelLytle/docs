    <br>You climb the ladder and it take you to a different part of the endless rooms.<br>
    <br>Everything looks the same but different at the same time.<br>
    <br>You walk around more and suddenly you see smoke come out of a vent on the roof.<br>
    <br>It scared you so hide behind the corner and you see a human like dog come out of the vent.<br>
    <br>It starts coming your way and you take off running. You're able to lose sight of it.<br>
    <br>You then turn a corner and see a pitch black smiling man with wide open eyes.<br>
    <br>With no hesitation you take off running again. You hide behind a dark corner and the smiling man runs past you. Losing you.<br>
    <br>You wonder what both those things even were and where they came from but before you can think more the lights tunr red.<br>
    <br>You freak out and look for anywhere to hide. To your left you see an empty locker and you jump right in it.<br>
    <br>A tall black creature with long limps and no face comes running by.<br>
    <br>It leaves and you hop out of the locker. You continue wandering.<br>
