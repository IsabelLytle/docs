    <br>You make your way up to the fifth floor. You had heard rumors about this place but never saw any of it yourself.<br>
    <br>Weird things would happen on the fifth floor that were just unexplained.<br>
    <br>You build up your courage to go inside. You open the door and see a confusing sight.<br>
    <br>You just see a bunch of manikins.<br>
    <br>You're confused but you search through the floor anyway. The whole time you feel like you're being watched.<br>
    <br>You turn around and see that the manikins have changed positions.<br>
    <br>You think maybe you're just seeing things. You keep exploring and tunr around again. They're closer.<br>
    <br>You're freaked out by this and you decide to leave.<br>
    <br>As you get closer to the door you turn around and see the manikins start to run towards you.<br>
