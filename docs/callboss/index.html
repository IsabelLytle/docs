    <br>You take out your phone and call your boss but no answer.<br>
    <br>You decide to call again but still, no answer.<br>
    <br>You decide to go to go to the back of the building to try the back entrance.<br>
    <br>It's unlocked!<br>
    <br>You walk through the door and it closes behind you. You start walking up the stairwell to get to your floor.<br>
    <br>You keep walking and walking and walking and walking for what seems like forever.<br>
    <br>You realize you've gone nowhere<br>
    <br>You walk back down to go through the first floor door.<br>
    <br>You enter and to your surprise, no one is there. It's the quietest the building has ever been.<br>
    <br>You walk around for a bit and find no one.<br>
    <br>You see a note that says,"They took us."<br>
    <br>Do you...<br>
