    <br>You realize that you're trapped. You've been trapped by this random wave you for some reason decided to surf.<br>
    <br>You notice you're not getting hungry or even thirsty.<br>
    <br>It's like this place wants you to live. Wants you to be alive while you're stuck here.<br>
    <br>It won't let you take an easy way out. You're trapped.<br>
    <br>You wonder what even caused this weird day to occur.<br>
    <br>Could you have changed it?<br>
    <br>Could you have had a normal day?<br>
    <br>You wished for a normal day that was not possible.<br>
