    <br>The man catches up to you and grabs you.<br>
    <br>He turns you so that you are now looking into his eyes.<br>
    <br>You see nothing but emptiness in his eyes. Not even a soul. This creature was made here. This creature has been here.<br>
    <br>You notice your eyesight starts to fade. There's nothing you can do.<br>
    <br>You wonder if you made all the right choices.<br>
    <br>You can no longer see. You can't move. You're gone.<br>
