    <br>You call the cops and when they arrive you fill them in on the strangeness of the situation.<br>
    <br>They escort you outside to have you wait for them out there to be safe.<br>
    <br>You wait for them for what feels like an hour.<br>
    <br>They never came back.<br>
    <br>You wonder what even could've happened to them.<br>
    <br>You walk in and see two cops still with fear as a tall all pitch black smiling man is standing over them.<br>
    <br>The smiling man walks away slowly and disappears around a dark corner.<br>
    <br>You go to check the officers and they don't respond. They're terrified.<br>
    <br>You want to call more police but don't want anyone else to get hurt and you don't even know if they'd believe a crazy story like this.<br>
    <br>Do you...<br>
