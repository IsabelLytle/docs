    <br>You step on it. You wheeve through traffic while the cop follows close behind.<br>
    <br>You then see 2 more cop cars join him in the chase. You realize that you may have overreacted but it's too late now.<br>
    <br>You keep driving until you're hit with a major traffic jam. You get out of your car and start running.<br>
    <br>The cops get out and start chasing you and catch up to you. They tackle you to the ground and handcuff you.<br>
    <br>You're taken to the station and lcoked up until they're able to deal with you.<br>
    <br>They tell you that you have no jail time but are put on probation and your license is suspended.<br>

    <br>When you walk in you notice a family is living there. You ask them what they're doing in your house and they say that it's their home and has been for years.<br>
    <br>You tell them that's impossible because you've lived there for 5 years now. That's when you realize none of your stuff is there. It's like you never lived there at all.<br>

    <br>Your friend answers you but not in a way you hoped. They tell you they have no idea who you are and to stop calling and they hang up.<br>
    <br>You're left feeling very confused. No one knows who you are. What happened?<br>
    <br>You decide to go to the beach to get your mind off things.<br>
    <br>When you arrive at the beach there's offers to rent a surfboard. But you see signs saying not to go past 10 meters of the shore.<br>
    <br>Do you...<br>
