    <br>You start walking towards the water and relax in the shallow.<br>
    <br>You don't want to go past 10 meters so you just lay back and float there thinking about the crazy day you've had.<br>
    <br>You still have no idea why no one remembers you. You still have no idea what to do about it.<br>
    <br>You don't know what you can do about it.<br>
    <br>You realize there IS nothing you can do. You have no idea what anomaly caused this.<br>
    <br>You will just have to start your life new.<br>
