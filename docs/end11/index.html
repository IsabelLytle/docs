    <br>You sprint towards the door and just make it.<br>
    <br>You're confused on what even just happened but you don't care. You're freaked out and decide to just leave.<br>
    <br>You go home and just sit and watch TV to try and get your mind off the freak show you witnessed earlier.<br>
    <br>You go upstairs in the dark and see what looks like a manikin and get scared but it was just an old coat rack.<br>
    <br>You throw out the old coat rack and try and get some sleep.<br>
    <br>You will never see manikins the same again.<br>
